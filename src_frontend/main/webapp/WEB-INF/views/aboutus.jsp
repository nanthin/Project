A laptop computer, sometimes called a notebook computer by manufacturers, is a battery- or AC-powered personal computer generally smaller than a briefcase that can easily be
 transported and conveniently used in temporary spaces such as on airplanes, in libraries, temporary offices, and at meetings.

Laptop computers, also known as notebooks, are portable computers that you can take with you and use in different environments. They include a screen, keyboard, and a trackpad or trackball, which serves as the mouse. Because laptops are meant to be used on the go, they have a battery which allows them to operate without being plugged
 into a power outlet. Laptops also include a power adapter that allows them to use power from an outlet and recharges the battery.
